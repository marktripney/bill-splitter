<p>We already learned how to perform basic arithmetics in Python.

For collections, addition can have different meanings depending on the context. For lists, it usually refers to concatenation, which means joining two lists end-to-end to create a new list. For sets, addition represents the union operation, which creates a new set containing all elements from both sets, without any duplicates.">addition</a>, subtraction, <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/5865" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Python, multiplication is a mathematical operation that involves multiplying a number by itself or by another number. | It is represented by the asterisk symbol (\*). Multiplication has a higher priority over other operations such as addition and subtraction. However, in cases where multiple operations have the same priority, Python follows a left-to-right operation convention. For example, in the expression 2 * 3 - 4, the multiplication is performed first, resulting in 6 - 4, which then evaluates to 2. It is important to note that multiplication can also be performed using exponentiation, where a number is multiplied by itself a certain number of times.">multiplication</a>, division and several other built-in operations.

Python has different types of numbers, including integers (int) and floating-point numbers (float). Integers are whole numbers, either positive, negative, or zero, without a decimal point. Floats, on the other hand, represent real numbers and have a decimal point. Although they can represent the same value, integers and floats are different objects in Python, and the code checks them for identity, not equality. To compare numbers in Python, you can define methods that allow for smooth comparison. Additionally, Python provides dunder methods, also known as magic methods, that are useful when you want to introduce math in your class.">numbers</a> we can use built-in mathematical functions or functions from the <code class="language-python"><samp>math</samp></code> module.</p>

There is a difference between division and integer division. The first produces a floating-point number, while the second one produces an integer value, ignoring the decimal part. Python raises an error if you try to divide by zero. Arithmetic operations can be combined to write more complex expressions. For instance, subtraction or division would be done similarly. The main principle with these methods is to understand what a particular operation means for your object and then define the corresponding method. Python also has a number of methods for augmented assignment, which are a combination of standard arithmetic operations with the assignment. Their names are pretty self-explanatory, such as += or -=. For complex numbers, you can define the method for the += operator, which would work by adding the right operand to the current value of the left operand. Additionally, you can compare objects using comparison operators such as &lt;, &gt;, ==, etc.">arithmetic operations</a>, familiarized ourselves with arithmetics and geometry in <samp>math</samp> module, and calculated the volume of a cylinder. As you can see, it is possible to round a number or find a maximum value in Python using just built-in functions.
